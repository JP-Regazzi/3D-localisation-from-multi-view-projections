# 3D-localisation-from-multi-view-projections

The project involves leveraging data acquired from multiple projections (different viewpoints angles) of a scene, to localise 3D indications on X-Ray images. Using image processing techniques and deep learning models, the goal is to optimize the localization of 3D indications within the studied object. Challenges include effectively using multi-view information, exploiting the acquisition geometry and combining image processing with deep learning for better accuracy.

Here we have the implementation of two approaches to tackle this challenge: Faster R-CNN fine-tuning and a Geometry-based 3D detection. Please read the Project Report for more information.
